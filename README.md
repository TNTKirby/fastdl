FastDL for when I host server (from my PC) on TF2C.

It has downloads for maps, but more importantly, a "Modular Custom Item Schema"
A Custom Item Schema that can enable/disable specific stuff, like LiveTF2 or Custom Weapons from other servers.

Still working on getting custom weapon models/materials in... -n-
