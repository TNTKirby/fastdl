FastDL for when I host server (from my PC) on TF2C.

It has downloads for maps, but more importantly, a "Modular Custom Item Schema"
A Custom Item Schema that can enable/disable specific stuff, like LiveTF2 or Custom Weapons from other servers.

The Custom Weapons servers will keep updating, and so I'll try my best to keep up with the item schemas and custom models.
