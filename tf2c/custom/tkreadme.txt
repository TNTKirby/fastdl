This is extra fastdl for custom stuff on my server. You'll have to download the folders you want yourself.

Mainly for now, "Custom Player Models" as I cannot get it to fastdl by itself since of precache limits on server sides, due to lots of models and materials added with the custom weapons.

So if you want to use "Custom Player Models," put the folder in your "custom" folder, and restart your game.

If you do not want it anymore, you can just delete it, or put it in a "disabled" folder.
